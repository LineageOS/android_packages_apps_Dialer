      "message": "To make dialmaps switch, the most simple approach is to change them here. My only concern is, will that be correct? I mean, we\u0027re calling this constructor from another one (line 57), which sets a fixed dialmap, and replace it here with something else. I\u0027d like to keep changes to a minimum here, but on the other hand, I don\u0027t want to put a \"code-monkey-style\" solution too.\n\nCould anyone please help me with that?",
