/**
 * A singleton to queue and run {@link Task} with the {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}. A task
 * is queued by sending a broadcast to {@link TaskReceiver}. The intent should contain enough
 * information in {@link Intent#getExtras()} to construct the task (see {@link
 * Tasks#createIntent(Context, Class)}).
 *
 * <p>The executor will only exist when {@link TaskSchedulerJobService} is running.
 *
 * <p>All tasks are ran in the background with a wakelock being held by the {@link
 * android.app.job.JobScheduler}, which is between {@link #onStartJob(Job, List)} and {@link
 * #finishJobAsync()}. The {@link TaskSchedulerJobService} also has a {@link TaskQueue}, but the
 * data is stored in the {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler} instead of the process memory, so if
 * the process is killed the queued tasks will be restored. If a new task is added, a new {@link
 * TaskSchedulerJobService} will be scheduled to run the task. If the job is already scheduled, the
 * new task will be pushed into the queue of the scheduled job. If the job is already running, the
 * job will be queued in process memory.
 *
 * <p>Only one task will be ran at a time, and same task cannot exist in the queue at the same time.
 * Refer to {@link TaskQueue} for queuing and execution order.
 *
 * <p>If there are still tasks in the queue but none are executable immediately, the service will
 * enter a "sleep", pushing all remaining task into a new job and end the current job.
 *
 * <p>The executor will be started when {@link TaskSchedulerJobService} is running, and stopped when
 * there are no more tasks in the queue or when the executor is put to sleep.
 *
 * <p>{@link android.app.job.JobScheduler} is not used directly due to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link android.telecom.PhoneAccountHandle} used to differentiate task can not be easily
 *       mapped into an integer for job id
 *   <li>A job cannot be mutated to store information such as retry count.
 * </ul>
