/**
 * A classifier which calculates the variance of differences between successive angles in a stroke.
 * For each stroke it keeps its last three points. If some successive points are the same, it
 * ignores the repetitions. If a new point is added, the classifier calculates the angle between the
 * last three points. After that, it calculates the difference between this angle and the previously
 * calculated angle. Then it calculates the variance of the differences from a stroke. To the
 * differences there is artificially added value 0.0 and the difference between the first angle and
 * PI (angles are in radians). It helps with strokes which have few points and punishes more strokes
 * which are not smooth.
 *
 * <p>This classifier also tries to split the stroke into two parts in the place in which the
 * biggest angle is. It calculates the angle variance of the two parts and sums them up. The reason
 * the classifier is doing this, is because some human swipes at the beginning go for a moment in
 * one direction and then they rapidly change direction for the rest of the stroke (like a tick).
 * The final result is the minimum of angle variance of the whole stroke and the sum of angle
 * variances of the two parts split up. The classifier tries the tick option only if the first part
 * is shorter than the second part.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the classifier classifies the angles as left angles (those angles which value is
 * in [0.0, PI - ANGLE_DEVIATION) interval), straight angles ([PI - ANGLE_DEVIATION, PI +
 * ANGLE_DEVIATION] interval) and right angles ((PI + ANGLE_DEVIATION, 2 * PI) interval) and then
 * calculates the percentage of angles which are in the same direction (straight angles can be left
 * angels or right angles)
