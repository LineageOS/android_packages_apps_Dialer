/**
 * Stores a fake screen on/off state for the {@link InCallActivity}. If InCallActivity see the state
 * is off, it will draw a black view over the activity pretending the screen is off.
 *
 * <p>If the screen is already touched when the screen is turned on, the OS behavior is sending a
 * new DOWN event once the point started moving and then behave as a normal gesture. To prevent
 * accidental answer/rejects, touches that started when the screen is off should be ignored.
 *
 * <p>a bug on certain devices with N-DR1, if the screen is already touched when the screen is
 * turned on, a "DOWN MOVE UP" will be sent for each movement before the touch is actually released.
 * These events is hard to discern from other normal events, and keeping the screen on reduces its'
 * probability.
