/**
 * Interface used to submit {@link AsyncTask} objects to run in the background.
 *
 * <p>This interface has a direct parallel with the {@link Executor} interface. It exists to
 * decouple the mechanics of AsyncTask submission from the description of how that AsyncTask will
 * execute.
 *
 * <p>One immediate benefit of this approach is that testing becomes much easier, since it is easy
 * to introduce a mock or fake AsyncTaskExecutor in unit/integration tests, and thus inspect which
 * tasks have been submitted and control their execution in an orderly manner.
 *
 * <p>Another benefit in due course will be the management of the submitted tasks. An extension to
 * this interface is planned to allow Activities to easily cancel all the submitted tasks that are
 * still pending in the onDestroy() method of the Activity.
