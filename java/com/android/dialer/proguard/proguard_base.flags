# This file is intended to contain proguard options that *nobody* would ever
# not want, in *any* configuration - they ensure basic correctness, and have
# no downsides. You probably do not want to make changes to this file.

# The presence of both of these attributes causes dalvik and other jvms to print
# stack traces on uncaught exceptions, which is necessary to get useful crash
# reports.

# Preverification was introduced in Java 6 to enable faster classloading, but
# dex doesn't use the java .class format, so it has no benefit and can cause
# problems.
-dontpreverify

# Skipping analysis of some classes may make proguard strip something that's
# needed.
-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses

# Case-insensitive filesystems can't handle when a.class and A.class exist in
# the same directory.

# This prevents the names of native methods from being obfuscated and prevents
# UnsatisfiedLinkErrors.

# hackbod discourages the use of enums on android, but if you use them, they
# should work. Allow instantiation via reflection by keeping the values method.

# classes are obfuscated, shrunk, and/or optimized.
