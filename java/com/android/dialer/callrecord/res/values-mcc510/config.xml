<!--Disable call recording for country: Indonesia-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Based on Article 26 of both Law Number 11 of 2008 and its revision, Law Number 19 of 2016, call
     recording is defined on its own and requires one to obtain consent from the other party when
     recording calls, although it can be used as a form of evidence. Whether recording another
     person without his or her consent is a criminal offense that is prosecuted by the country
     itself is not clear and further information should be gathered by a native speaker.
     Law 11 of 2008 (first file):
