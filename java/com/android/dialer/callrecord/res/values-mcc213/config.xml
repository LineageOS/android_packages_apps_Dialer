<!--Disable call recording for country: Andorra-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 183 of the Andorran Penal Code sets a prison sentence of one to four years as the
     punishment for attempting or succeeding to infringe on the privacy of another person without
     his or her consent. This includes intercepting calls or using technical means to listen,
     transmit, record or reproduce their calls. Article 185 and 188 of the Andorran Penal Code
     describe the length of imprisonment when sharing recordings with third parties, even if one has
     not partaken in their creation, unless the party was unaware of their illicit origin. The
     attempt to do any of the above is also punishable by law.
     Penal Code, as of 2014:
