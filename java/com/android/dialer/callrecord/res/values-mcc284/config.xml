<!--Enable call recording for country: Bulgaria-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 32(2) of the Bulgarian Constitution states that it is an inviolable right for people to
     not be followed, photographed, recorded (audio and/or video) without being notified and/or
     despite his or her explicit disagreement to said actions, except where the law allows for said
     actions. The Code of Criminal Procedure, Part III, Articles 125 and 126, page 34, deal with the
     use of recordings as evidence. No law explicitly tackles the issue of consent when recording
     one's personal telephone calls. Based on the available documentation and the attached example
     of lack of state prosecution, recording one's own calls is not legal, nor is it a criminal
     offense. Personal recordings are unlikely to be usable as evidence in a court of law.
