     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Privacy is a fundamental right in Portuguese law, as it is defined in Articles 26(1) and 34 of
     the Portuguese Constitution. Infringing on said rights constitutes a crime, as defined in
     Articles 192(1), 194(2) and 199(1) of the Portuguese Penal Code. The punishment is imprisonment
     for a period of up to one year or a fine equaling 240 days of pay, either of which may be
     increased by a third, based on Article 197. Lower courts and Higher courts have been ruling
     both for and against recording one's own calls, no matter the reason, and there have been
     numerous cases of exceptions being made, despite what the law says. A complaint has been lodged
     with the European Court of Human Rights, which may lead to a reversal in the current laws and
     prohibitions. It is noteworthy that in one case, the Supreme Court rendered a decision, which
     can be translated as such: "The protection of speech that embodies criminal practices or the
     image that portrays them must yield to the interest of protecting the victim and the efficiency
     of criminal justice: protection ends when what is protected is a crime."
