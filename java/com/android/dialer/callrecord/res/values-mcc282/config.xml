     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Constitution of Georgia, Chapter Two - Fundamental Human Rights, Article 15(2) states that
     personal communication(s) are inviolable and that said right may only be restricted in
     accordance with the law, to ensure national security or public safety, or to protect the rights
     of other parties, insofar as it is necessary in a democratic society, based on a court decision
     or without a court decision in cases of urgent necessity, as provided by the law. Articles 157,
     158 and 159 of the Criminal Code of Georgia deal with the disclosure of private information,
     personal data, the violation of the secrecy of private communication and the violation of
     secrecy of personal correspondence, phone conversations or other kinds of communication. The
     document does not specify a situation in which one side of a conversation records without the
     other side's knowledge or consent, thus the act of recording one's conversations is in a
     legally gray area. All of the above articles explicitly note that no criminal liability can be
     incurred if the gathered information is submitted to investigative authorities.
