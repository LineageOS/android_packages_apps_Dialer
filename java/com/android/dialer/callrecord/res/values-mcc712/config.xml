     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     One may record one's own calls, as long as they are calls between said person and only one
     other party, that is two say two sides. Calls between 3 or more people can not be legally
     recorded without all sides agreeing to one person doing so, as long as said person is a part of
     the call and not wiretapping or eavesdropping. Recording calls with more than 2 participants
     requires the express consent of all other parties. Article 29 of the Communication Law of 1994
     specifies under what circumstances one may or may not do so.
