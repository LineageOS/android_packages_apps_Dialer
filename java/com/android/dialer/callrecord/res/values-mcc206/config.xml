<!--Enable call recording for country: Belgium-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     As stated in the official response below, Belgian law does not consider the recording of one's
     personal communications as a punishable offense. Using said recordings in a fraudulent and/or
     demeaning way does carry the potential for liability and/or prosecution by the state. The
     recording of one's own calls might be regarded as a form of personal data processing, depending
     on the specifics of the case. Specific laws and cases are quoted within the official response.
     Official Response by Belgian Minister (QRVA 50 157, internal pages 20199-20202, 24/02/2003):
