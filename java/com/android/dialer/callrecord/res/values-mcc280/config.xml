<!--Enable call recording for country: Cyprus-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Cypriot Penal Code does not explicitly cover the act of wiretapping or recording one's own
     calls. Based on this, it is not a criminal offense to record personal calls. Article 369 of the
     Cypriot Penal Code states that anyone who knows that another is planning to commit a criminal
     offense, yet fails to use any reasonable means to prevent said crime, is guilty of misconduct,
     which can be used as a reason for recording one's own calls, should the need arise to quote
     a legal document.
