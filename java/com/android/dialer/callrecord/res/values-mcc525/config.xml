<!--Enable call recording for country: Singapore-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Singaporean law does not recognize privacy as a right that can be infringed upon. A party can
     not be prosecuted or sued for recording a conversation he or she is a part of. The only
     exception is when said recording contains confidential information, in which case the party may
     or may not be liable for their actions, if said party makes use of said confidential
     information in a way that clearly brings him or her gains of any sort, and/or harms the other
     party in any perceivable way.
