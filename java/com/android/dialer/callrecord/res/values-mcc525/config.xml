     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Singaporean law does not recognize privacy as infringeable upon. Based on this, one can not be
     prosecuted or sued for recording a conversation. The only exception is when said recording
     contains confidential information, in which case one the party may or may not be liable for
     recording a call, if said party makes use of the confidential information for any gains in
     his or her favor, or for any harms that may come to the other party.
