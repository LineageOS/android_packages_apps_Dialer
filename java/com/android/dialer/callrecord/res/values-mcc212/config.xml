     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to the Penal Code of Monaco, Article 308-2, a person may be punished with a prison
     sentence of six months to three years, as well as a fine, for infinging or attempting to
     infinge on a person's rights to privacy. This includes wiretapping, recording or transmitting
     the words spoken by a person in a private place. Consent will be presumed when such an action
     is done during a meeting, with the knowledge of the person that is being recorded. Article 344
     of the Penal Code mentions the same punishment for purposeful wiretapping.
