<!--Enable call recording for country: Malta-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 34 (1)(f) of the Maltese Constitution states that a person may be deprived of his
     rights in the case of there being suspicion of said person having commited, or being in the
     process of committing a crime. Effectively this means that recording your own calls is legal
     when done so to report a crime. There is no mention of the act of recording one's own calls in
     the Maltese Criminal Code, which means that even if it were to be illegal, it is not a criminal
     offense. The Media and Defamation Act of 2018 handles all cases of defamation, which may or may
     not include the act of publishing one's call recordings without the knowledge or consent of the
     other concerned party.
