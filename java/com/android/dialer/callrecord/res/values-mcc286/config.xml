     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 132 of Law 5237, the Turkish Penal Code, sets the punishment for violating the secrecy
     of communication as six months to two years of imprisonment. If the violation of secresy is
     done in the form of a recording, then the punishment is imprisonment of one to three years. The
     act of unlawfully publishing the contents of a communication is imprisonment of one to three
     years. Openly disclosing the content of a communication between oneself and others, without the
     other party or parties' consent, is imprisonment of six months to two years. If disclosure is
     done by way of the press or broadcast, the punishment is increased by one half. One may listen
     and record conversations of other parties, with the consent of at least one party. Doing so
     without consent is punishable with imprisonment of two to six months. Article 135 of the
     Turkish Penal Code defines punishment in the case of recording personal data and information.
     It stands to reason that one may record one's own calls without the consent of the other party,
     but the act of sharing those recordings in any way may result in persecution, either in the
     form of a criminal or civil case against the party that has recorded his or hew own calls.
