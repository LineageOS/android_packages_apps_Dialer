<!--Allow recording for country: Australia -->
<!--All states and territories permit recording one's phone calls,
subject to certain restrictions. In summary, recording of a phone
conversation by a person is allowed when, depending on the state:
 a) the person is a party to the conversation; or
 b) the person is a principal party (person by whom or to whom words
 are spoken), and
  i)  the recording is reasonably necessary for the protection of that
      person's lawful interests, or
  ii) the recording is not made for the purpose of communicating or
      publishing the conversation to persons who are not parties to
      the conversation.
