<!--Enable call recording for country: Ukraine-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Dissemination of a call without consent is a punishable offense, and can not be used as valid
     proof in a court of law. Call recordings may be handed, by one of the two parties without the
     other party's consent, to the authorities when a crime is specified in the recording. In such
     cases the party that handed over the recording is not liable to fines or punishment, as the
     authorities will use the recording to initiate an investigation, but not as proof of a crime.
