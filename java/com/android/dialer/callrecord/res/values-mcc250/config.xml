<!--Enable call recording for country: Russia-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Recording a phone call when not one of the two parties participating in said call is illegal
     and punishable by law. As a party to a phone call, one may record it without notifying the
     other side, as is evident in the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia for case 35-KG16-18,
     which was rendered on the 6th of December 2016. This concerns civil cases between two private
     citizens. Whether this covers cases involving legal entities or people holding a public
     position has not been researched. The key laws to consider are the Federal Law of 27th July
     2006, N 149-FZ, (amended on 18th March 2019) "Information, Information Technologies and
     Information Security" - article 9, subarticle 8, as well as the Civil Procedure Code of 2002,
     N 138-FZ (amended on the 27th December 2018), article 55. Citations of other pertinent laws may
     be found in the linked decision, starting at internal document page number 4.
