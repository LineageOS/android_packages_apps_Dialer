     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Luxembourgish Penal Code does not specifically cover the right to privacy and its
     infringement. Based on this, it is not a criminal offense to record one's personal calls,
     although doing so in a public manner may lead to a civil case from the aggrieved party. One
     should consult further with a lawyer whether sharing said recording or recordings would
     constitute a criminal offense.
