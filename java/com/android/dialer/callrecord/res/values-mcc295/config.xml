<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Recording a call between an organization and an individual is illegal, when done without
     notification and/or consent. Recording a call between individuals is illegal and punishable,
     when transmitting said recording or information to a third party, and/or when the person that
     initiates the recording is not part of the conversation. This means that recording a call when
     you are one of the two parties is legal, even without notifying the other party. Legal action
     must be initiated by the aggrieved party. The following is defined in Article 120 of the
     Criminal Code of 24 June 1987 (StGB), points 1, 2, 2a and 3. Article 100 of the Constitution
     may be pertinent to use of call recordings as evidence.
