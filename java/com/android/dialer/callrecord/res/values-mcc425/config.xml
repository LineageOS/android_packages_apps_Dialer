<!--Enable call recording for country: Israel-->
<!--This MCC is also used by: Occupied Palestinian Territory-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Israeli law specifies that call recording is illegal and punishable when neither party in said
     conversation is aware of said act of recording. Either party in a conversation can record his
     or her calls without being legally required to inform the other party.
     Due to legal ambiguity, it is currently impossible to determine which set of laws should be
     taken under consideration when recording personal calls within the Occupied Palestinian
     Territory. This is relevant as the Occupied Palestinian Territory makes use of the Mobile
     Country Code registered to Israel.
