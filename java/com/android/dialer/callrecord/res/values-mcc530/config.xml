     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to the Crimes Act of 1961, Public Act 216B, Articles 1 and 2(a), every one is liable
     to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years for intentionally intercepting any private
     communication, unless he or she is a party to that private communication. Public Act 216C,
     subsections (1) and (2) define the prohibition on disclosure of unlawfully intercepted private
     communications. The recording of one's personal conversations and their publishing or use as
     evidence without the other party's consent is not explicitly forbidden, nor is it defined as a
     criminal offense.
