<!--Enable call recording for country: Serbia-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 143 of the Serbian Penal Code covers unauthorized wiretapping and recordings. While it
     is criminally punishable to share call recordings or wiretap them, the law specifically states
     recording is only punishable when said recording is 'not meant for him/her', hence it is legal
     to record your own calls, but not to share them with third parties.
