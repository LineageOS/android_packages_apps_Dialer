<!--Enable call recording for country: Norway-->
<!--
     As a private citizen, one may record any call that they participate in. There is no requirement
     to make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of said recording(s), depending on
     the content, may be subject to various laws, such as data protection (privacy) legislation,
     libel laws, laws governing trade and national secrets, non-disclosure agreements and so on. It
     is, however, prohibited to record calls without the permission of the other party or parties,
     if you are making the call on behalf of a company or organization. All of the above is outlined
     in Article 205 of the Norwegian Penal Code.
     Penal Code:
