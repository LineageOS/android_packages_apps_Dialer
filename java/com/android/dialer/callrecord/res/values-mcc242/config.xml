<!--Enable call recording for country: Norway-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     As a private citizen, one may record any call they participate in. There is no requirement to 
     make other parties aware of the recording, but the use of said recordings, depending on their 
     content, may be subject to various laws, such as data protection (privacy) legislation, libel 
     laws, laws governing trade and national secrets, non-disclosure agreements and so on. It is 
     however prohibited to record calls without other parties permission if you are making the call 
     on behalf of a company or organization.
