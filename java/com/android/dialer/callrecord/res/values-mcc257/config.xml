<!--Enable call recording for country: Belarus-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 28 of the Constitution of Belarus covers the right to privacy. Article 179 of the
     Criminal Code of Belarus covers situations in which a person's privacy is violated by way of
     any secret being shared without his or her consent, but no specific term of imprisonment or
     fine is mentioned. The wording of the article is aimed at the collecting and sharing of 'a
     personal or family secret of another person'. Creating a call recording for personal use is not
     covered by this article, as privacy is not inherently guaranteed. The use of call recordings as
     evidence in a court of law is dubious. The sharing of a call recording could be considered as
     punishable by law, depending on the circumstances.
