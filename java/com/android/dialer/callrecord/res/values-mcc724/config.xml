<!--Enable call recording for country: Brazil-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Call recording is not a criminal offense when it the recording is made by one of the two
     parties of said call. Interception by a third party is illegal and punishable by law, unless
     done according to the requirements set out in Law 9296. There may be some debate, as far as the
     use of a call recording as legitimate evidence. Further information is available in the
     attached legal discussions below.
