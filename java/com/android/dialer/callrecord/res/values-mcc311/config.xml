<!--Disable call recording for country: United States of America-->
<!--MCCs that conform to this country's state legislation: 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 316, 330-->
<!--MCCs that conform to this country's federal legislation: 544-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Currently federal laws state that call recording is legal. On the other hand, each state has
     its own laws which take priority. Most states allow call recording when one sides agrees, but
     over 10 require both sides to agree. Since there are no unique MCC codes per state, there is no
     way to differentiate whether the state you are currently in allows call recording. Due to this,
     call recording is set as disabled for the United States of America and some of its territories.
     These include Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
     Until a method for properly differentiating between states is created, or a law or precedent
     emerges which would allow call recording to be legal everywhere, this file and its connected
     files should remain in their current form.
