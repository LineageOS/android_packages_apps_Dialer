<!--Enable call recording for country: Kosovo-->
<!--
     Article 36 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the Right to Privacy. Articles 202, 203, 204
     and 205 define punishment and exceptions for call recording. Only third-party interception is
     defined, hence call recording without consent is not a criminal offense.
