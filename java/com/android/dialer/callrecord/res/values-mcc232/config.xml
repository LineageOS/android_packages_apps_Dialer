<!--Enable call recording for country: Austria-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to Article 93 (3) of Austrian Communications Law, known as TKG 2003
     Kommunikationsgeheimnis, it is illegal to record a call or pass on information about a call,
     unless you are one of the parties in that call. While recording is not illegal, sharing the
     recording might be a punishable offense, without the consent of both sides.
