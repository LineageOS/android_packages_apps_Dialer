    <!-- Disable recording for Andorra:
         Article 183 of the Andorran Penal Code sets a prison sentence of one to four years as the
         punishment for attempting or succeeding to infringe on the privacy of another person
         without his or her consent. This includes intercepting calls or using technical means to
         listen, transmit, record or reproduce their calls. Article 185 and 188 of the Andorran
         Penal Code describe the length of imprisonment when sharing recordings with third parties,
         even if one has not partaken in their creation, unless the party was unaware of their
         illicit origin. The attempt to do any of the above is also punishable by law.

         Article 121, 122 and 123 of the Albanian Penal Code cover the right to privacy, wiretapping

         offense to record your own calls, but sharing them with a third party or using them to harm
         the other party in said calls is a criminal offense.

         specifically mention call recording done by a person that is a party to the call, with or
         without consent, then the act of doing so is not a criminal offense, as it carries no

           A person shall not use a listening device to record a private conversation to which the

           is, or is not, a party. The penalty is $5 000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.
           This does not apply to the use of a listening device by a party to a private conversation
           if that principal party consents to its use, as reasonably necessary for the protection
           of the lawful interests of that principal party. It is also not applicable in cases where
           a person who is a party to a private conversation, or is acting on behalf of a party to a
           private conversation, uses a listening device to record said private conversation,
           believing that the use of the listening device is in the public interest.

         Summary:
           Most states and territories allow to make a recording of your personal conversations
           under specific circumstances. The wording of the laws themselves are open to
           legal interpretation and can be used against users. Until the laws above are presented
           in a more clear way or enough evidence is shown to substantiate how the courts interpret
           them when prosecuting private citizens, Australia shall not have call recording enabled.

    <!-- Enable recording for Belgium:
         As stated in the official response below, Belgian law does not consider the recording of
         one's personal communications as a punishable offense. Using said recordings in a
         fraudulent and/or demeaning way does carry the potential for liability and/or prosecution
         by the state. The recording of one's own calls might be regarded as a form of personal data
         processing, depending on the specifics of the case. Specific laws and cases are quoted
         within the official response. The Belgian municipality of Baarle-Hertog, consisting of a
         number of exclaves, has territory which is within the Dutch province of North Brabant, and
         as such it may not be within the confines of the Belgian ISO and its inherent laws.

         notified and/or despite his or her explicit disagreement to said actions, except where the
         law allows for said actions. The Code of Criminal Procedure, Part III, Articles 125 and
         126, page 34, deal with the use of recordings as evidence. No law explicitly tackles the
         issue of consent when recording one's personal telephone calls. Based on the available
         documentation and the attached example of lack of state prosecution, recording one's own
         calls is not legal, nor is it a criminal offense. Personal recordings are unlikely to be
         a valid form of evidence in a court of law.

         of any secret being shared without his or her consent, but no specific term of imprisonment
         or fine is mentioned. The wording of the article is aimed at the collecting and sharing of
         'a personal or family secret of another person'. Creating a call recording for personal use
         is not covered by this article, as privacy is not inherently guaranteed. The use of call
         recordings as evidence in a court of law is dubious. The sharing of a call recording could

    <!-- Enable recording for South Korea:
         According to Article 3(1) of the Protection of Communications Secrets Act, it is forbidden
         to wiretap, record or listen to any conversation between other parties. Article 4 defines
         recordings obtained by way of illegal recording or wiretapping as inadmissible, hence they
         can not be used as evidence in a trial or disciplinary procedure. Article 14 goes on to
         specify that no person shall record a conversation between other parties, that is not
         public, or listen to said parties' conversation through the use of electronic or mechanical
         devices. Definitions of recording, wiretapping and other such terms may be found in Article
         2. The Protection of Communications Secrets Act clearly defines that recording is not legal
         when done by a third party, but does not specifically discuss whether whether both parties
         to a conversation need to agree to a recording. Since there is no penalty listed, recording
         one's own conversations should be in, at worst, a gray area that should still not make the
         act punishable. Similarly, whether recordings made without consent can be used as evidence
         is legally unclear.

         Recording a call between an organization and an individual is illegal, when done without

         when transmitting said recording or information to a third party, and/or when the person
         that initiates the recording is not part of the conversation. This means that recording a
         call when you are one of the two parties is legal, even without notifying the other party.
         Legal action must be initiated by the aggrieved party. The following is defined in Article
         120 of the Criminal Code of 24 June 1987 (StGB), points 1, 2, 2a and 3. Article 100 of the

         calls in the Maltese Criminal Code, which means that even if it were to be illegal, it is

    <!-- Enable recording for Russia:
         Recording a phone call when not one of the two parties participating in said call is
         illegal and punishable by law. As a party to a phone call, one may record it without
         notifying the other side, as is evident in the decision of the Supreme Court of Russia for
         case 35-KG16-18, which was rendered on the 6th of December 2016. This concerns civil cases
         between two private citizens. Whether this covers cases involving legal entities or people
         holding a public position has not been researched. The key laws to consider are the Federal
         Law of 27th July 2006, N 149-FZ, (amended on 18th March 2019) "Information, Information
         Technologies and Information Security" - Article 9, Subarticle 8, as well as the Civil
         Procedure Code of 2002, N 138-FZ (amended on the 27th December 2018), article 55. Citations

    <!-- Enable recording for Singapore:
         Singaporean law does not recognize privacy as a right that can be infringed upon. A party
         can not be prosecuted or sued for recording a conversation he or she is a part of. The only
         exception is when said recording contains confidential information, in which case the party
         may or may not be liable for their actions, if said party makes use of said confidential
         information in a way that clearly brings him or her gains of any sort, and/or harms the

    <!-- Enable recording for Slovenia:
         Article 148 of the Slovenian Criminal Code covers the unlawful eavesdropping and sound
         recording. Subarticle 1 defines a maximum punishment of no more than one year for the
         unlawful eavesdropping or recording of a private conversation by use of special devices,
         or directly transmitting said conversation to a third person. This also includes passing on
         the gist of said conversation. Subarticle 2 states that recording another person's
         statement with the intent to misuse it, without his or her consent, is punishable in the
         way postulated in Subarticle 1. Prosecution is initiated by the aggrieved party for
         Subarticle 1, while under Subarticle 2 it is initiated upon a private action. Based on
         Article 148, it is legal to record one's own calls, when not done so with the intent to
         misuse said recordings. Sharing said recordings in any way may be deemed a criminal or
         civil offense.

    <!-- Enable recording for Slovakia:
         Sections 376 and 377 of the Slovakian Criminal Code cover breach of confidentiality of
         spoken utterance and other forms of personal expression and the breach of secrecy of all
         types of instruments, recordings and documents. Section 376 states that the breach of
         secrecy, by way of disclosing or making available to a third party and/or using it to cause
         serious harm to another party, leads to an imprisonment of up to two years. Section 377
         defines breach of confidentiality as the making of an unlawful recording accessible to a
         third person or using it in any way that would hinder the other side's rights. This is
         punishable with a term of imprisonment of up to two years.

    <!-- Enable recording for Turkey:
         Article 132 of Law 5237, the Turkish Penal Code, sets the punishment for violating the
         secrecy of communication as six months to two years of imprisonment. If the violation of
         secrecy is done in the form of a recording, then the punishment is imprisonment of one to
         three years. The act of unlawfully publishing the contents of a communication is
         imprisonment of one to three years. Openly disclosing the content of a communication
         between oneself and others, without the other party or parties' consent, is imprisonment of
         six months to two years. If disclosure is done by way of the press or broadcast, the
         punishment is increased by one half. One may listen and record conversations of other
         parties, with the consent of at least one party. Doing so without consent is punishable
         with imprisonment of two to six months. Article 135 of the Turkish Penal Code defines
         punishment in the case of recording personal data and information. It stands to reason that
         one may record one's own calls without the consent of the other party, but the act of
         sharing those recordings in any way may result in persecution, either in the form of a
         criminal or civil case against the party that has recorded his or hew own calls.

    <!-- Enable recording for Ukraine:
         Sharing a call recording without consent is a punishable offense, and can not be used as
         valid proof in a court of law. Call recordings may be handed over to the authorities, by
         one of the two parties without the other party's consent, when a crime is mentioned in the
         recording. In such cases the party that handed over the recording is not liable to fines or
         punishment, as the authorities will use the recording to initiate an investigation, but not
         as proof of a crime. The above information is covered in Articles 31 and 32 of the

    <!-- Disable recording for United States of America, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the
                               United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico:
         Currently federal laws state that call recording is legal. On the other hand, each state
         has its own laws which take priority. Most states allow call recording when one sides
         agrees, but over 10 require both sides to agree. Since there are no ISO country codes per
         state, there is no way to differentiate whether the state you are currently in allows call
         recording or not. Due to this, call recording is set as disabled for the United States of
         America and some of its territories. These include Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the
         United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Until a method for properly differentiating
         between states is created, or a law or precedent emerges which would allow call recording
         to be legal in all of the USA and its territories, all aforementioned countries and
         territories should be set as false. Even if such a method is to be found, there is still
         the question of Native American Reservations, territories that have a cumulative size of
         over 200 000 square kilometers and might enforce their own set of laws for call recording.

    <!-- Enable recording for Kosovo:
         Article 36 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the Right to Privacy. Article 202 of the
         Criminal Code of Kosovo covers the infringing of privacy in corresepondence and computer
         databases, which can be best explained as the act of violating and/or sharing a private
         document with another person. Article 203 covers the unauthorized disclosure of
         confidential information, when the person disclosing said information is under legal duty
         to maintain it as confidential. Said person is not liable when the disclosure of the
         confidential information is done so in the interest of the public. Paragraph 4 describes
         public interest as the welfare of the general public outweighing the individual interest.
         It is also permissible to use this as a defense when the disclosed information involves
         plans, preparation or the commission of crimes against the constitutional order or
         territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo or other criminal offenses that will cause
         great bodily injury or death to another person. Article 204 covers the unauthorized
         interception of a conversation or statement. Article 205 covers the unauthorized
         photographing or video recording of a person 'in his or her personal premises or in any
         other place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy', with paragraph 4
         offering an exception for liability when the act is done to discover a criminal offence or
         the perpetrators of a criminal offence, or to present as evidence to the police,
         prosecution or court, and if the photos or recordings are submitted to these authorities.
         It is beyond doubt that none of these articles deal with recording personal conversation
         between two parties, hence the act of doing so is not explicitly punishable and is not a
         criminal offense that would warrant a criminal case.
