<!--Enable call recording for country: Netherlands-->
<!--MCCs that conform to this country's legislation: 204, 362 and 363-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Recording one's own conversations without the consent of the other party or parties is not in
     itself punishable by law. Sharing recordings made without consent is punishable in the form of
     a libel case. This in effect means that the government shall not prosecute anyone for the
     recording of calls. Call recordings may be used as evidence in criminal and civil cases.
