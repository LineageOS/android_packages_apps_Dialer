<!--Enable call recording for country: Armenia-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Armenian Criminal Code discusses the legality and punishment of call recordings, when
     recorded by a third party, otherwise known as wiretapping. Since the Criminal Code does not
     specifically mention call recording done by a person that is a party to the call, with or
     without consent, then the act of doing so is not a criminal offense, as it carries no
     punishment whatsoever.
