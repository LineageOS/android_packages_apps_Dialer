<!--Enable call recording for country: Japan-->
<!--MCCs that conform to this country's legislation: 440 and 441-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Recording one's own calls is neither a criminal offense, nor illegal. Wiretapping and leaking
     information gained from a recording is illegal and may be criminally punishable. Recording as
     a third party is a criminal offense, when done so without the consent of at least one party to
     the conversation. Recordings obtained without consent from both sides will not be admitted as
     evidence in a criminal case, but are admitted as such in most civil cases, unless it was
     obtained in a method, which the court deems as unacceptable. If the recording infringes one's
     personal rights or discloses trade secrets, sharing said recording might lead to civil cases.
     In work-related instances, one may record and divulge information under the protection of the
     Whistleblower Protection Act of 2004. The Supreme Court of Japan's Decision of the 12th of July
     2000, case number 1999 (A) 96, was in favor of admitting a tape recording as evidence, which
     was made by one party to a conversation, without the other party's consent.
