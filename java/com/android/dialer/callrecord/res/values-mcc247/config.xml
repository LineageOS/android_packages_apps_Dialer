<!--Enable call recording for country: Latvia-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     There is no clear definition of call recording by itself within the Criminal Law of Latvia.
     Article 144 of said law covers breach of information secrecy, when said information is in the
     form of correspondence or data relayed by way of electronic communications networks. Paragraph
     (1) defines the punishment for 'violating the secret of a person's correspondence' as a term of
     imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or others. In a 2014 e-Consultation, the Deputy
     Head of the Public Relations Department of the State Police, Tom Sadovsky, defined the
     recording of calls with the intent to use as evidence as legal. The Personal Data Protection
     Law does not apply, as it considers the communication between individuals and legal entitites.
