     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 143 of the Croatian Criminal Code, Paragraph 1 notes that the recording of another
     person's privately uttered words is a criminal offense, when said words are not 'intended for
     his or her attention' and could lead to imprisonment not exceeding three years. Paragraph 2,
     which holds the same punishment, indicated that situations in which the recording, its
     transcription or the 'gist' of said recording being shared as an equal crime. Paragraph 4
     states that there is no criminal offence if said acts are committed in 'the public interest or
     another interest prevailing over the interest to protect the privacy of the person being
     recorded or eavesdropped on'. Prosecution is made per request and the state does not initiate
     it, which renders the matter to the level of a civil case and not to that of a criminal case.
