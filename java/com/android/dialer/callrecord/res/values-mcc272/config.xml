<!--Enable call recording for country: Ireland-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Irish Constitution does not specifically state a right to privacy. Subsection (6) of
     section 98  of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation)
     Act of 1993 defines interception of a call in such a way, that deems the recording of a call by
     one party to the call legal. Whether said call recording can be used as evidence or infringes
     upon a person's privacy is a complicated matter that can only be decided on a case-by-case
     basis. Subsection (2) of section 98 goes on to elabore on cases in which call recordings are
     legal, such as in the interests of the security of the State (c), for the prevention or
     detection of crime or for the purpose of any criminal proceedings (b) and others.
