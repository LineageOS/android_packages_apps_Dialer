     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Sections 413 and 418 define the Breach of Trade and/or Business Secrecy as a criminal offense.
     There is no mention of wiretapping and/or eavesdropping as a criminal offense.
     The Hungarian Data Protection and Freedom of Information Agency (DPA) created a Guidance in
     2016, for cases concerning situations which include an individual as one side of the
     conversation, and a data processing entity as the other side. This guidance should not be
     considered relevant, as it does not deal with the communications of individuals. No pertinent
     articles or paragraphs were found in the Hungarian Criminal Code, which in effect equates to
     there being no punishment for the recording of personal calls.
