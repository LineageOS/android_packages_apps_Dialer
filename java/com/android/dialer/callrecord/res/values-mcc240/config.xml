     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to the Swedish Penal Code (Brottsbalken), Chapter 4, 8–9 §§, it is illegal to make
     unauthorized recordings of telephone conversations as a third party. A court can grant
     permission for law enforcement agencies to tap telephone lines. Anyone participating in the
     telephone call may record the conversation. A recording is always admissible as evidence in
     a court of law, even when obtained in an illegal way.
