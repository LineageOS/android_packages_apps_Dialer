     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to Section 201 of the German Criminal Code - Violation of the privacy of the spoken
     word, making an audio recording of the privately spoken words of another or making such a
     recording accessible by a third party will result in up to three years of imprisonment. Article
     10 of the German Constitution explicitly states that the secrecy of telecommunications is
     inviolable. There are notable exceptions, such as the use of recordings when in a legitimate
     self-defense situation. Article 227 of the German Civil Code notes that acting in one's own
     defense is not unlawful, which is also explained in Article 32 of the German Criminal Code.
     Article 88 of the Telecommunications Act defines telecommunications secrecy.
