     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 121, 122 and 123 of the Albanian Penal Code cover the right to privacy, wiretapping and
     harming other via dissemination of their secrets. Based on these, it is not a criminal offense
     to record your own calls, but sharing them with a third party or using them to harm the other
     party in said calls is a criminal offense.
