<!--Enable call recording for country: Chile-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Chilean law is considered a type of civil law, hence judges base their decisions on their
     own reading of the law. The Chilean Supreme Court ruled in favor of accepting one-party consent
     call recording as a form of legal evidence, hence the act of recording your own calls is not
     criminally punishable, as can be seen in the Chilean Penal Code.
