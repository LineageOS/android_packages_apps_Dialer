     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     While recording calls without consent, as a third party, is punishable, it depends on whether
     said recording was created or used with a malicious intent. Judges are free to view said
     recordings as a form of evidence and base their final decisions with their help. Recording your
     own calls as a private citizen is not a criminal offense. Sharing said recordings, with the
     intent to harm the other party in any way, is a criminal offense.
