     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to the Electronic Communications Act, No. 81, recording one's own telephone
     conversations without notifying the other party can make the recording party liable to fines or
     imprisonment of up to six months in the case of serious or repeated violations, as explicitly
     stated in Article 74. Article 48 covers the Recording of telephone calls and states that the
     party to a telephone conversation that wishes to record said conversation shall, when it
     commences, notify the opposite party of his or her intent to do so. This not required when the
     opposite party can clearly be assumed to be aware of the recording.
