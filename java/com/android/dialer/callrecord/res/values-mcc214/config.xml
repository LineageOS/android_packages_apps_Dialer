<!--Enable call recording for country: Spain-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Based on the decision of the Spanish Constitutional Tribunal of November the 29th, 1984, it is
     legal for a party to record his or her calls without notifying the other party. Sharing said
     recording with a third party is not protected and may make the party that has shared the
     recording liable to a civil suit, to be initiated by the aggrieved party. Unless done so for
     judicial purposes, it is punishable to disclose or share the recording or the gist of the
     recording to other parties.
