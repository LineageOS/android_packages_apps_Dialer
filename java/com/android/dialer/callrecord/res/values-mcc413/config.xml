<!--Enable call recording for country: Sri Lanka-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Part IV/59 of the Sri Lankan Telecommunications Act defines the penalty for eavesdropping on a
     call. The Sri Lankan Penal Code does not cover the act of recording one's own calls, hence the
     act is not criminally punishable.
