     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     According to Article 3(1) of the Protection of Communications Secrets Act, it is forbidden to
     wiretap, record or listen to any conversation between other parties. Article 4 defines
     recordings obtained by way of illegal recording or wiretapping as inadmissible, hence they can
     not be used as evidence in a trial or disciplinary procedure. Article 14 goes on to specify
     that no person shall record a conversation between other parties that is not public, or listen
     to said parties' conversation through the use of electronic or mechanical devices. Definitions
     of recording, wiretapping and other such terms may be found in Article 2. The Protection of
     Communications Secrets Act clearly defines that recording is not legal when done by a third
     party, but does not specifically discuss whether whether both parties to a conversation need to
     agree to a recording. Since there is no penalty listed, recording one's own conversations
     should be in, at worst, a gray area that should still not make the act punishable. Similarly,
     whether recordings made without consent can be used as evidence is legally unclear.
