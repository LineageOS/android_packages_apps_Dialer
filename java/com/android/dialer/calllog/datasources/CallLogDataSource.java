/**
 * A source of data for one or more columns in the annotated call log.
 *
 * <p>Data sources have three lifecycle operations, which are always called on the same thread and
 * in the same order for a particular "checkDirtyAndRebuild" cycle. However, not all operations are
 * always invoked.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #isDirty()}: Invoked only if the framework doesn't yet know if a rebuild is
 *       necessary.
 *   <li>{@link #fill(CallLogMutations)}: Invoked only if the framework determined a rebuild is
 *       necessary.
 *   <li>{@link #onSuccessfulFill()}: Invoked if and only if fill was previously called and the
 *       mutations provided by the previous fill operation succeeded in being applied.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Because {@link #isDirty()} is not always invoked, {@link #fill(CallLogMutations)} shouldn't
 * rely on any state saved during {@link #isDirty()}. It <em>is</em> safe to assume that {@link
 * #onSuccessfulFill()} refers to the previous fill operation.
 *
 * <p>The same data source objects may be reused across multiple checkDirtyAndRebuild cycles, so
 * implementors should take care to clear any internal state at the start of a new cycle.
