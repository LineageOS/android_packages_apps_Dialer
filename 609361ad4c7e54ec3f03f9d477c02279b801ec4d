      "message": "An adapter would make sense if we had enough recordings to warrant scrolling, but in that scenario we would probably want to display them in a new activity (rather than a list view within a list view).  \n\nI would expect the case where we have more than a few recordings per call to be pretty rare, so I\u0027m more inclined to optimize the experience for the case where we have 1-2 recordings.",
