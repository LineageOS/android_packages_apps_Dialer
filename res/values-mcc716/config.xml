<!--Enable call recording for country: Peru-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Peruvian Constitution states that people own their own voice and images. If said images or
     recordings are made for archival purposes, it is allowed. While wiretapping is illegal, it has
     been used as legal evidence in a court of law. As long as one of the persons talking agrees
     to the recording, said recording can be used in a court of law. There may be exceptions if the
     communication contains information that may affect third parties, or if it can be considered as
     information that should be blocked by medical or legal confidentiality.
