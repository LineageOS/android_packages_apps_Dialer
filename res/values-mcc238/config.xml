     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Chapter 27, Article 263(3) of the Criminal Code of Denmark denotes that a person is liable for
     criminal punishment when he or she intercepts or records telephone conversations to which he or
     she is not a party. The articles in Chapter 27 cover a lot of different situations, including
     the dissemination of recordings, which may lead to a fine or prison sentence. The act of
     recording a conversation that one is a part of is not covered explicitly, hence it is not a
     criminal offense in the eyes of the law. This, however, does not exclude civil cases.
