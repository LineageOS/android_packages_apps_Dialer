     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     The Telecommunications Act (506/2004) states that the recording of a conversation by a party to
     that conversation is permitted and not a criminal offense. Nevertheless, while such recordings
     are legal, making use of them may fall subject to further civil or criminal laws. Admissibility
     as evidence depends on how the recording was obtained.
