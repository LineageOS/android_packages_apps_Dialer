     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     It is not illegal to record a conversation, as parties to calls automatically accept the risk
     that a call may be recorded. Making a recording available to other parties is a criminal
     offense, when done so for reasons other than protecting either one's own rights or other
     parties' rights. Articles 23 and 167, in the Privacy Code, deem that the crimes provided for
     therein are punishable only if said acts result in harm. According to the Supreme Court of
     Cassation, recorded conversations are legal and can be used as evidence in court, even if the
     other party is unaware of being recorded, provided that it is not recorded by a third party.
