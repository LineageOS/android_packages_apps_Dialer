<!--Enable call recording for country: Argentina-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Argentina follows the continental law system. If a law does not exist, which defines something
     as a crime, it is not a crime. Judges in Argentina make decisions based on their reading of the
     law, and not on precedents. Call recording is currently not defined as a crime in any law. This
     is defined in Section 19 of the Constitution of the Argentine Nation.
