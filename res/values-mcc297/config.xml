     Article 173 of the Criminal Code of Montenegro marks call recording as legal if the content of
     the conversation was 'intended for your use'. It is also legal when it concerns the prevention
     of crimes, which carry a sentence of 5 years minimum. Sharing a conversation to a third party
     is a criminal offense.
