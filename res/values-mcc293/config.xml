     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Australian Capital Territory:
     Subsection 4(3)(b) Listening Devices Act 1992 (ACT)
     https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/act/consol_act/lda1992181/s4.html
     A person must not use a listening device with the intention of recording a private conversation
     to which the person is a party. This does not apply when said listening device is used by, or
     on behalf of, a party to a private conversation if a principal party to the conversation
     consents to the listening device being so used, and the recording of the conversation is
     considered by that principal party, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary for the protection
     of that principal party's lawful interests; or the recording is not made for the purpose of
     communicating or publishing the conversation, or a report of the conversation, to any person
     who is not a party to the conversation.
     New South Wales:
     Subsection 7(3)(b) Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/sda2007210/s7.html
     A person must not knowingly use a listening device to record a private conversation to which
     the person is a party. This does not apply when a principal party to the conversation consents
     to the listening device being so used and the recording of the conversation is reasonably
     necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that principal party, or is not made
     for the purpose of communicating or publishing the conversation, or a report of the
     conversation, to persons who are not parties to the conversation.
     Northern Territory:
     Subsection 11(1)(a) Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NT)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nt/num_act/sda200719o2007256/s11.html
     Subsection 43, Emergency use of listening device in public interest
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nt/num_act/sda200719o2007256/s43.html
     It is an offence to use a listening device to record a private conversation to which the person
     is not a party and the device is used without the express or implied consent of each party to
     the conversation. Under Section 43, a person may use a listening device to record a private
     conversation if at the time of use there are reasonable grounds for believing the circumstances
     are so serious and the matter is of such urgency that the use of the device is in the public
     interest.
     Queensland:
     Subsection 43(2)(a) Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 (Qld)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/qld/consol_act/iopa1971222/s43.html
     A person is guilty of an offence, if the person uses a listening device to record a private
     conversation and is liable to a maximum penalty of 40 penalty units or imprisonment for 2
     years. This does not apply when the person using the listening device is a party to the
     private conversation.
     South Australia:
     Subsection 4(2)(a)(ii) Surveillance Devices Act 2016 (SA)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/sa/consol_act/sda2016210/s4.html
     A person must not knowingly use a listening device to record a private conversation to which
     the person is, or is not a party. The maximum penalty is $15 000 or imprisonment for 3 years.
     This does not apply if the use of a listening device is done by a party to the private
     conversation if the use of the device is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful
     interests of that person.
     Tasmania:
     Subsection 5(3)(b) Listening Devices Act 1991 (TAS)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/tas/consol_act/lda1991181/s5.html
     A person shall not use a listening device to record a private conversation to which the person
     is, or is not, a party. This does not apply when the listening device is used to obtain
     evidence or information in connection with an imminent threat of serious violence to persons or
     of substantial damage to property, or a serious narcotics offence, if the person using the
     listening device believes on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to use the device
     immediately to obtain that evidence or information. This does not apply if a principal party
     to the conversation consents to the listening device being so used and the recording of the
     conversation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that
     principal party or the recording of the conversation is not made for the purpose of
     communicating or publishing the conversation, or a report of the conversation, to persons who
     are not parties to the conversation.
     Victoria:
     Subsection 6(1) Surveillance Devices Act 1999 (NSW)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/vic/consol_act/sda1999210/s6.html
     A person must not knowingly use a listening device to record a private conversation to which
     the person is not a party. The penalty is up to 2 years imprisonment and up to 240 penalty
     units, or both.
     Western Australia:
     Subsection 5(3)(d) Surveillance Devices Act 1998 (WA)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/wa/consol_act/sda1998210/s5.html
     Subsection 26(1)(2)(3)(b)
     https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/wa/consol_act/sda1998210/s26.html
     A person shall not use a listening device to record a conversation to which that person is, or
     is not, a party. The penalty is $5 000 or imprisonment for 12 months, or both. This does not
     apply to the use of a listening device by a party to a private conversation if that principal
     party consents to its use, as reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests
     of that principal party. It is also not applicable in cases where a person who is a party to
     a private conversation, or is acting on behalf of a party to a private conversation, uses a
     listening device to record said private conversation, believing that the use of the listening
     device is in the public interest.
     Summary:
     Most states and territories allow to make a recording of your personal conversations under
     specific circumstances. The key exception is the State of South Australia, which does not allow
     a party to single-handedly record their conversations. Since there is no way to distinguish
     between the states and territories based on MCC, call recording will continue to be disabled
     for Australia, until there are changes to the laws of the State of Victoria.
