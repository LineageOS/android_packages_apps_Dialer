     Article 36 of the Constitution of Kosovo defines the Right to Privacy. Article 202 of the
     Criminal Code of Kosovo covers the infringing of privacy in corresepondence and computer
     databases, which can be best explained as the act of violating and/or sharing a private
     document with another person. Article 203 covers the unauthorized disclosure of confidential
     information, when the person disclosing said information is under legal duty to maintain it as
     confidential. Said person is not liable when the disclosure of the confidential information is
     done so in the interest of the public. Paragraph 4 describes public interest as the welfare of
     the general public outweighing the individual interest. It is also permissible to use this as a
     defense when the disclosed information 'involves plans, preparation or the commission of crimes
     against the constitutional order or territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo or other
     criminal offenses that will cause great bodily injury or death to another person'. Article 204
     covers the unauthorized interception of a conversation or statement. Article 205 covers the
     unauthorized photographing or video recording of a person 'in his or her personal premises or
     in any other place where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy', with paragraph 4
     offering an exception for liability when the act is done to 'conducted to discover a criminal
     offence or the perpetrators of a criminal offence, or to present as evidence to the police,
     prosecution or court, and if the photos or recordings are submitted to these authorities'.
     It is beyond doubt that none of these articles deal with recording personal conversation
     between two parties, hence the act of doing so is not explicitly punishable and is not a
     criminal offense that would warrant a criminal case.
