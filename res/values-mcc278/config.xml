     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 148 of the Slovenian Criminal Code covers the unlawful eavesdropping and sound
     recording. Subarticle 1 defines a maximum punishment of no more than one year for the unlawful
     eavesdropping or recording of a private conversation by use of special devices, or directly
     transmitting said conversation to a third person. This also includes passing on the gist of
     said conversation. Subarticle 2 states that recording another person's statement with the
     intent to misuse it, without his or her consent, is punishable in the way postulated in
     Subarticle 1. Prosecution is initiated by the aggrieved party for Subarticle 1, while under
     Subarticle 2 it is initiated upon a private action. Based on Article 148, it is legal to record
     one's own calls, when not done so with the intent to misuse said recordings. Sharing said
     recordings in any way may be deemed a criminal or civil offense.
