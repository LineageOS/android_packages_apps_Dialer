     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Article 166 of the Lithuanian Criminal Code defines that violations of a person's
     correspondence, by unlawfully wiretapping a person's conversations as a criminal offense, which
     could lead to a term of imprisonment of up to two years, a fine or community service. The
     wording of said article is unclear and only mentions electronic communication networks and
     recording and/or wiretapping as a third party, and not as one of the two parties. Article 61 of
     the Law on Electronic Communications defines confidentiality of communications, as far as
     situations like those covered by GDPR, as in the handling of information between individuals
     and legal entities, and should therefore not be taken into account.
