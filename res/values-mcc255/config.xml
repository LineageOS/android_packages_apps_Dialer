<!--Enable call recording for country: Ukraine-->
<!--
     Relevant laws and/or legal precedents:
     Sharing a call recording without consent is a punishable offense, and can not be used as valid
     proof in a court of law. Call recordings may be handed over to the authorities, by one of the
     two parties without the other party's consent, when a crime is mentioned in the recording. In
     such cases the party that handed over the recording is not liable to fines or punishment, as
     the authorities will use the recording to initiate an investigation, but not as proof of a
     crime. The above information is covered in Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution, as well as
     Articles 163, 182 and 359 of the Criminal Code.
